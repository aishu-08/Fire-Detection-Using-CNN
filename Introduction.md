# Fire-Detection-Using-CNN

## About our Project:
 Fire is one of the deadliest risks any living things can encounter in their life. In a concise time 
frame, fire can wreck an area, say in a forest, hut, house, building, etc. Fire can lead to the 
loss of expensive property, and in the worst possible scenario, it can also lead to the loss of 
human life. Detecting fire thus becomes a significant concern.

 Our project will carry out fire detection by adopting an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model based 
on chromatic and disorder measurement for extracting fire pixels. To prevent this, we will 
build an early fire detection using image segmentation with the help of the Convolution 
Neural Network (CNN) model with alarm system.

## Need for the study
We have come across many incidences in and around our locality where fire will cause a 
huge destruction to the property. After going through many research we do know that there 
are smoke detectors and various other technologies to get to know whether there is a fire or 
not. But we realized that there is need for detection of fire before smoke appears where we 
could detect the source of fire and immediately raise an alert. By doing this we feel that 
common man should be able to implement our model and he/she can prevent major loss that 
is being caused by fire. Therefore we have done fire detection at first sight and it will raise an 
alarm as soon as it detects fire.

## Objectives
Our main aim is to locate the position where the fire is present, which will help the authorities 
take proper measures to avoid any loss. This project aims to build a deep neural network 
model that will give the best accuracy in detecting fire
