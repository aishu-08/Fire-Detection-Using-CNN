# Fire-Detection-Using-CNN
## Fire is one of the deadliest risks any living things can encounter in their life. In a concise time 
frame, fire can wreck an area, say in a forest, hut, house, building, etc. Fire can lead to the 
loss of expensive property, and in the worst possible scenario, it can also lead to the loss of 
human life. Detecting fire thus becomes a significant concern.

## Our project will carry out fire detection by adopting an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model based 
on chromatic and disorder measurement for extracting fire pixels. To prevent this, we will 
build an early fire detection using image segmentation with the help of the Convolution 
Neural Network (CNN) model with alarm system.
