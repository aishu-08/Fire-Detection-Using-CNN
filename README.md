# Fire-Detection-Using-CNN

## Problem Statement
To locate the position where the fire is present in the image and to build a deep neural network 
model CNN, that will give the best accuracy in detecting fire.

## Toolkit
Tensorflow

## Methodology 
CNN - CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK - 
 By using CNN we classified whether a image belongs to fire or not fire.
After detecting it has fire we implemented a small alarm sysytem to get notified.

## Learning
It was a knowledge gaining experience. Both models have widened our knowledge in the 
field of machine learning. Today we are happy for learning the basics of two models. We 
have learned to fix the errors that occurred during the project with the help of our fellow mates.
We have learned the working of CNN as well as VGG16. Each of it has its own features, uses 
and drawbacks. 
Apart from the project we have learned to work in the team by lifting up each others and 
passing on our knowledge. 
As we have worked with two models and if someone asks which was better we will definitely 
suggest CNN model as we were able to fix alarm when model detects fire.
